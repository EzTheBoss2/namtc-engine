# namtc-engine
This is the engine that was to be used for NAMTGC before it was canceled. It has some cool functionality 
which may be useful to makers who want to expand upon the original format. Namely it has true fullscreen, 
without distortion, a movable hud, and a mouse reader for stats. I do not expect any games to be made 
soley from this engine, instead I hope this can provide ideas / utility form which you can build a more
polished project. My thanks go out to all those who signed up to be perticipents for the collab.
